# QSeek

## Author: XiangHe and Shaowei Cai

​		**QSeek** is a local search solver designed for general **mixed-integer quadratic programming** (MIQCQP) problems. QSeek is the updated version of **LS-IQCQP**. Unlike its predecessor, LS-IQCQP, which primarily solves integer quadratic constrained quadratic programming (IQCQP) problems, QSeek extends its capabilities to not only solve integer but also **mixed-integer** problems.



- To use QSeek,  **run ./qpsolver cutoff_time(second) filename.lp**.
